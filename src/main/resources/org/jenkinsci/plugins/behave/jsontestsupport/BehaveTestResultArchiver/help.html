    Behave test results report in JSON format.
    When this option is configured, Jenkins can provide useful information about test results,
    such as historical test result trends, a web UI for viewing test reports, tracking failures,
    and so on.

    <p>
        To use this feature, first set up your build to run tests, then
        specify the path to Behave JSON files in the
        <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Ant glob syntax</a>,
        such as <tt>**/build/test-reports/*.json</tt>. Be sure not to include any non-report
        files into this pattern. You can specify only one file pattern.

    <p>
        Once there are a few builds running with test results, you should start seeing
        something like <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Behave+Test+Result+Plugin">this</a>.
